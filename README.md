## General Information
E-commerce companies lose millions of dollars every year due to late shipments and incorrect arrival predictions. Therefore, We tried to build a ML model that can correctly predict whether e-commerce product shipments will be delivered on time. Also, we tried to identified some of the siginificant factors that could affect the outcome of the prediction. We expect to help e-commerce companies to save cost by this ML model. 

It was a final group project for "Big Data Machine Learning" course at JHU.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Unexpected low accuarcy and AUC, not ready for use in industry
- Limited ML models

To do:
- Collect more data with more features
- Implement better ML methods
